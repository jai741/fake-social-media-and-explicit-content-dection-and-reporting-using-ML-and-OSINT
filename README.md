Instagram Fake Profile Detector
In this practical project, we will build and train a simple artificial neural network model to detect spam/fake Instagram accounts. Fake and spam accounts pose a serious problem on social media platforms. Many individuals on social media resort to creating fake Instagram accounts to give the illusion of a large number of followers. Fake accounts can be used to impersonate others and also for the sale of fraudulent services/products. The data for this project has been sourced from the Kaggle website. In this practical project, we will go through the following stages:

Importing the dataset and libraries
Conducting exploratory data analysis
Visualizing the data
Preparing the data for modeling
Building and training a simple deep learning model
Evaluating the trained model.
